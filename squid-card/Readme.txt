Installation:
1.) Put the script in your resources folder
2.) Import the .sql file to your database
3.) Add 'ensure squid-card-item' to your server.cfg

SQL is not important it you want you can add sql without sql this script will work just add suid-card item in shared.lua

["squid-card"] 				      = {["name"] = "squid-card", 			 	  	["label"] = "Squid Game Card", 		    ["weight"] = 125, 		["type"] = "item", 	    ["image"] = "notes.png", 				["unique"] = false, 	["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = true,    ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "mestry"},
